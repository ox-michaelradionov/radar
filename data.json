Due to the way in which functional languages manage state, interest in these languages has increased by many developers seeking to make the most out of multi-core processors. Many concurrent languages are also functional languages. The distinction lies in the emphasis on running operations in parallel.

The social networking aspect that GitHub and Bitbucket have brought to distributed version control has helped to propel these tools forward and into enterprises looking for ways to develop across multiple geographies. The move for many to a distributed version control system has resulted in a move away from tools such as Subversion and other centralized version control systems. As organizations assess and choose between these two different toolsets, we suggest that you evaluate both in relation to your team’s specific needs. While we have seen widespread adoption of distributed version control tools within ThoughtWorks and beyond, we still advocate the use of continuous integration and limits to the amount of time that code is spent outside of the main branch.",

In the past year we have seen increased interest in evolutionary enterprise architecture and how service oriented architectures shape the boundaries between enterprise units. The value of an evolutionary approach to enterprise architecture is the creation of lighter weight systems that ease integration between disparate parts. By embracing this approach and the notion of the web as an enterprise application platform, we have reduced overall complexity of application architectures, increased quality and scalability, and reduced development costs.",

The social networking aspect that GitHub and Bitbucket have brought to distributed version control has helped to propel these tools forward and into enterprises looking for ways to develop across multiple geographies. The move for many to a distributed version control system has resulted in a move away from tools such as Subversion and other centralized version control systems. As organizations assess and choose between these two different toolsets, we suggest that you evaluate both in relation to your team’s specific needs. While we have seen widespread adoption of distributed version control tools within ThoughtWorks and beyond, we still advocate the use of continuous integration and limits to the amount of time that code is spent outside of the main branch.",

Although we have heard a wide range of opinions about the user experience offered by Google Mail, Calendar and Documents, the general consensus is that our largely consultant workforce is happy with the move. The next step that we as a company are looking to embrace is Google as a corporate platform beyond the standard Google Apps; in particular we are evaluating the use of Google App Engine for a number of internal systems initiatives. Google App Engine, Amazon EC2 and Salesforce.com all claim to be Cloud providers, yet each of their offerings differ. The Cloud fits into a broad categorization of service offerings split out into Infrastructure as a Service (e.g. Amazon EC2 and Rackspace), Platform as a Service (e.g. App Engine) and Software as a Service (e.g. Salesforce.com). In some cases, providers may span multiple service categories, further diluting the Cloud as a label. Regardless, the value of infrastructure, platform and software in the cloud is difficult to question and although many offerings have hit bumps in the road, they certainly have earned their position on the radar.",

Having waited for new language features to surface for almost 3 years, the Java community has begun to innovate in new languages that run on the Java Virtual Machine, languages such as Groovy, JRuby, Scala and Clojure. With the increase in number of languages available on the JVM, we expect enterprises to begin to assess the suitability of reducing the amount of Java specific code developed in their enterprise applications in favor of these newer languages. This is not to say that enterprises should outright abandon Java as a programming language, we do however suggest that you look for alternatives that may be more fi t for purpose in the area that new development is taking place.",

RIA is useful for complex visualizations but ill-suited for other programming tasks because it doesn’t fully support the engineering hygiene we require for our tools: testing is difficult and application partitioning is cumbersome. These frameworks also don’t support common elements we take for granted in applications hosted in a browser: bookmarking, addressability, browser controls, and other aspects. We’re not entirely critical of these tools, but think that their sweet spot is rich visualizations, not building traditional data entry CRUD applications.",

        "description": "The functional languages F#, Clojure and Scala still reside in the assess ring of the radar. Interest in functional languages continues to grow. Two characteristics of functional languages in particular are driving this interest, immutability with its implications for parallelism and functions as first class objects. While the introduction of closures to C# brings some of the latter capability, functional languages are almost synonymous with immutability. The placement of these languages within the assess ring indicates our view of their relative maturity and appropriateness. F#, based on OCaml, is fully supported within the Visual Studio toolset. F# includes support for objects and imperative constructs in addition to functional language constructs in a natural way. Scala, like F#, combines the object and functional paradigms, although the syntax of Scala is more Java-like. Clojure began as a JVM language and is now available on the .NET CLR. Clojure does allow for mutable state although it has an extensive set of immutable persistent data structures, all supporting multi-threaded applications. There are many similarities between these three languages, but at the moment we believe F# and Clojure to be better suited to most organizations for assessing than Scala. More work clearly needs to be done to validate this assertion.",

        "description": "Exposing APIs to a large developer community creates nonfunctional requirements that are often the same from one business to another. Key management, authentication, access control, traffic management, caching, tracking and reporting are often implemented as commodity functions that can be reused across applications and businesses without modification. Some service providers have spotted this trend and are offering API management via software as a service. Prominent vendors in this space include Mashery and Apigee, who both offer the option of hosting the service on a customer’s own infrastructure. API management services may also be interesting to enterprise customers who are using Web as platform techniques for their internal SOA, providing a lighter weight alternative to traditional SOA management tools.",

Capabilities describe an organization’s operating model in terms of goals and competencies (what is to be done), rather than implementation specifics (how things are done). Whereas business architecture models based on people, process or technology are contingent, volatile and often short lived, and therefore ill-suited to the long-term planning needs of the organization, capability models provide a description of the business context that is stable enough to serve as a basis for identifying and prioritising technology and process initiatives.",

        "description": "The functional languages F#, Clojure and Scala still reside in the assess ring of the radar. Interest in functional languages continues to grow. Two characteristics of functional languages in particular are driving this interest, immutability with its implications for parallelism and functions as first class objects. While the introduction of closures to C# brings some of the latter capability, functional languages are almost synonymous with immutability. The placement of these languages within the assess ring indicates our view of their relative maturity and appropriateness. F#, based on OCaml, is fully supported within the Visual Studio toolset. F# includes support for objects and imperative constructs in addition to functional language constructs in a natural way. Scala, like F#, combines the object and functional paradigms, although the syntax of Scala is more Java-like. Clojure began as a JVM language and is now available on the .NET CLR. Clojure does allow for mutable state although it has an extensive set of immutable persistent data structures, all supporting multi-threaded applications. There are many similarities between these three languages, but at the moment we believe F# and Clojure to be better suited to most organizations for assessing than Scala. More work clearly needs to be done to validate this assertion.",

While your development processes may be fully optimized, it still might take your organization weeks or months to get a single change into production. Continuous delivery focuses on maximizing automation including infrastructure as code, environment management and deployment automation to ensure your system is always ready for production. It is about tightening your feedback loops and not putting off anything until the end. Continuous delivery is not the same as continuous deployment, which means deploying every change to production. Continuous delivery is not a cowboy show. It puts you in charge of your production environment. The business can pick and choose what and when to deploy. If you think you’ve nailed agile development, but aren’t considering how to achieve continuous delivery, you really haven’t even started.",

        "description": "In contrast to traditional up-front, heavy-weight enterprise architectural designs, we recommend adopting evolutionary architecture. It provides the benefits of enterprise architecture without the problems caused by trying to accurately predict the future. Instead of guessing how components will be re-used, evolutionary architecture supports adaptability, using proper abstractions, database migrations, test suites, continuous integration and refactoring to harvest re-use as it occurs within a system. The driving technical requirements for a system should be identified early to ensure they are properly handled in subsequent designs and implementations. We advocate delaying decisions to the latest responsible moment, which might in fact be up-front for some decisions.",

        "description": "The functional languages F#, Clojure and Scala still reside in the assess ring of the radar. Interest in functional languages continues to grow. Two characteristics of functional languages in particular are driving this interest, immutability with its implications for parallelism and functions as first class objects. While the introduction of closures to C# brings some of the latter capability, functional languages are almost synonymous with immutability. The placement of these languages within the assess ring indicates our view of their relative maturity and appropriateness. F#, based on OCaml, is fully supported within the Visual Studio toolset. F# includes support for objects and imperative constructs in addition to functional language constructs in a natural way. Scala, like F#, combines the object and functional paradigms, although the syntax of Scala is more Java-like. Clojure began as a JVM language and is now available on the .NET CLR. Clojure does allow for mutable state although it has an extensive set of immutable persistent data structures, all supporting multi-threaded applications. There are many similarities between these three languages, but at the moment we believe F# and Clojure to be better suited to most organizations for assessing than Scala. More work clearly needs to be done to validate this assertion.",

The consequences of this are additional layers of complexity with no improvement in business flexibility.

It indexes files, statically or in real time, to generate canned or custom reports. If the raw log fields do not provide what you need, simply use a regular expression, either inline or to define a new field, to get the desired level of detail.

They offer incredible potential for prediction, forecasting, identifying repeatable patterns, and providing insight into unstructured data. Historically, our ability to store and rapidly analyze large amounts of audio, video and image data has been severely limited. This placed constraints on sample size, as well as the time it would take to validate analytical models and put them into production. Now, using a spectrum of new technologies like NoSQL, data harvesters, MapReduce frameworks, and clusters of shared-nothing commodity servers, we have the power necessary to make truly effective use of these techniques. Combined with the massive increase in global data available from sensors, mobile devices and social media and we see this as a field with tremendous opportunity.",

Much useful, qualitative feedback can be gathered quickly and cheaply through guerrilla user testing - by going out into the world and testing with small samples of the general public. Another alternative is remote usability testing, where you can send out everything from wireframes to final applications for testing by people all over the world. Usabila, Loop11 and Treejack all provide tools where you can ask users to carry out specific tasks, and capture everything from the time taken to complete a task, to the user’s thoughts and feelings while doing so.",

A traditional web or application server associates each incoming request with a thread until all the processing tasks associated with that request are complete and the response has been sent back. If any of those tasks involve I/O, the thread blocks while that I/O takes place. This approach can waste finite resources such as file descriptors and memory since each connection occupies a thread whether or not that thread is actually consuming CPU cycles. An alternative architecture is starting to emerge in implementations like Node.js (a JavaScript server running on Google V8), Nginx (an open source web server and proxy), and Webbit (a Java application server), that uses a single thread to serve many connections, processing all I/O asynchronously. These servers support orders of magnitude more simultaneous connections because each one consumes far fewer resources.",

This leads to data silos and the need to swivel-chair integrate between the tools in order to gather business intelligence that is crucial to running the business. This is a tool-led split in the analytics domain that hurts the team’s ability to make decisions. A much better solution is to have a consolidated view of near-real time analytics using integrated dashboards displaying time-sensitive domain and team relevant information.",

It is an extensible, multi-tenanted, and horizontally scalable search solution based on Apache Lucene. It allows complex data structures to be indexed and retrieved through a JSON based REST API. It provides an elegant model of operation with automatic discovery of peers in a cluster, failover, and replication. Elastic Search can be extended with a plugin system that allows adding new functionality and changing existing behavior. The community around this tool is quite vibrant as illustrated by the number of client libraries available in languages like Java, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.",

Assess adding these services to your toolkit where fast and low-cost proving of a new product idea is important. Our usual advice on build/buy/borrow decisions still applies: be clear on which functional areas are strategic to your business and which are commodities. For potentially strategic areas be sure to plan a migration path that will allow you to use the BaaS provider to get started quickly, while avoiding friction when your architecture evolves and you need to migrate to owning this functionality and customizing it as a differentiator.",

These tools have problems that make them unsuitable for fast moving software delivery. Large complex tools have high learning curves and require specialist skills and training, making it hard for the team themselves to test. Often this results in an unnecessary overhead for every release as other teams get involved. Expensive and limiting software licenses makes this problem even worse. Some heavyweight tools use a 'model driven' approach where an attempt is made to accurately model the usage patterns of the application, which leads to costly test script maintenance and development time being lost to 'false positives'. We have seen few situations where simple open source solutions cannot give the required level of confidence for much less time, effort and money.",

Although its roots are in Lisp, one of the oldest computer languages, it also embodies many modern programming concepts, including lazy evaluation and advanced concurrency abstractions. Clojure has spawned a vibrant community of programmers who are contributing a rich set of frameworks and tools. One example of these is Midje, an innovative spin on unit testing and mocking frameworks.",

We find thinking about the pace of change within different <strong>business capabilities</strong> (which can be made up of several architectural layers) to be a more useful concept. The danger in focusing on layers is that many types of change cut across multiple layers. For example, being able to add new class of stock to a website is not just about having an easy-to-change CMS; you also need to update the database, integration points, warehouse systems, etc. The recognition that some parts of an architecture need to be more maneuverable than others is useful.

Critics accuse REST of causing chatty, inefficient interactions among systems and failing to adapt as client needs evolve. They offer frameworks such as <a href=\"/radar/languages-and-frameworks/graphql\">GraphQL</a> or <a href=\"https://netflix.github.io/falcor/\">Falcor</a> as alternative data-fetch mechanisms that let the client specify the format of the data returned. But in our experience, it isn’t REST that causes these problems. Rather, they stem from a failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an <strong>anemic REST</strong> implementation. In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services. This antipattern is closely related to the <a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html\">Anemic Domain Model</a> pattern and results in services that rank low in <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html\">Richardson Maturity Model</a>.

It is designed to be a very flexible—and a less opinionated—library that offers a set of tools for building interactive web interfaces around concepts like modularity, components and reactive data flow. It has a low learning barrier, which makes it interesting for junior developers and beginners. Vue.js itself is not a full-blown framework; it is focused on the view layer only and therefore is easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.</p>",

When a JSPatch-enabled app runs, it loads a chunk of JavaScript (potentially via an insecure HTTP connection) and then bridges to the main Objective-C application code to change behavior, fix bugs, and so on. While convenient, we think monkey-patching live apps is a bad idea and should be avoided. When doing any amount of incremental patching, it's very important that your testing process matches what end users will experience, in order to properly validate functionality. An alternative approach is to use <a href='/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-native'>React Native</a> for the app and <a href='https://apphub.io/'>AppHub</a> and <a href='https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/'>CodePush</a> to push small updates and new features.</p>",

        "description": "Google Web Toolkit (GWT) offers an interesting premise: write Swing-like Java code and generate unit testable JavaScript widgets and user interfaces. From a practical standpoint this doesn’t work well. First, using code-gen to produce the artifacts is time consuming, artificially extending build times and requiring manual changes to obtain optimal package layout. Second, if the JavaScript doesn’t behave exactly as you want you will have to hack the generated code. Third, using Java to generate JavaScript means that you can’t take direct advantage of the powerful features of JavaScript or numerous libraries such as JQuery. Finally, the JUnit support is quite limited, for example code using reflection cannot be tested.",

These practices have their roots in the Toyota Production System and complement much of our understanding of Agile software development to date. One topic that Lean has also given us greater insight into is that of set-based design. Set-based design leads us to implement similar solutions at the same time while the cost of doing so is constrained. This leads us into the area of emergent design and the ability to let experience shape our design decisions and defer key decisions until the last responsible moment.",

This sort of test spans failover testing, performance testing and soak testing among others; these activities can start early in a project’s life-cycle and continue through to maintenance. The common practice of waiting until near the end of a project is fraught with risk with little time available to find and fix problems. For example the requirement for a comprehensive production-like environment before the start of performance testing is a dangerous fallacy, we can discover bottlenecks, track performance trends and test our performance tests, without waiting for a perfect environment.",

Since its introduction, however, C# has continued to move forward with the adoption of language features such as lambda expressions, extension methods, object initializers and automatic property setters and getters, all of which are available in the 3.5 release of the language. With the 4.0 release of C#, we will see the introduction of a dynamic keyword and named and optional parameters, which will continue to bring C# more in line with languages such as Ruby and well ahead of the Java language.",

Agile development practices have lead to greater emphasis on evolutionary database design, requiring new tools that support migration of schemas in line with changes to the domain model of an application. As storage space consistently becomes cheaper and data access speeds increase, many organizations are investigating the use of multiple schemas to hold data for different purposes, e.g. transactional and analysis schemas. Incremental data warehousing is becoming increasingly popular as the cost of moving data between a transactional data store and an analysis environment is less than the value of having access to near real-time reporting of critical business data.",

        "description": "Mobile Web was in our Assess category on previous radars, but we’ve moved it into Trial in recognition of the fact that the Web is increasingly consumed through iPhone, Android and tablet devices. Many devices can render a fair approximation of a desktop browser experience, but to present the user with a truly optimal experience we recommend adapting a site to the screen size, display and control behaviors particular to the device. Techniques such as progressive enhancement can allow a single site to adapt to both desktop and mobile browsers. Large format mobile devices, such as the Apple iPad and Amazon Kindle, provide a new model of ubiquitous computing. Their long battery life, simple interfaces and easy connectivity have the potential to change the way we interact with computers. Apple’s new user interfaces discard the familiar desktop metaphors of files and folders that have been standard since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.",

Unfortunately many frameworks for building computer to- computer systems on the Web are ignorant of this constraint and tend towards simple CRUD systems. Restfulie is the first of a new generation of frameworks that natively support hypermedia, for Ruby, Java, and .NET. In Restfulie, business protocols are implemented using DSLs and exposed across the Web through hypermedia representations; clients drive those protocols through a similar declarative mechanism, consuming server-generated representations as they work towards a business goal. As the fi rst framework of its kind, Restfulie is opinionated and provides strict “training wheels” in order to bootstrap newcomers. However, it is an empirical proof that the Web and hypermedia can be used to orchestrate complex business activities.",

This has lead us to prefer service choreography, where independently distributed participants collaborate according to an application protocol.

What is of particular interest to us is the way in which the project is being developed in Codeplex’s open source community. The ability for the community to steer the development of this part of the .NET platform merits this project’s early inclusion in the radar. While the license does allow for using the library in production today, given the current volatility of the API, we caution against taking a dependency at this early stage; many of the features we’ve admired in recent releases, such as its use of an attributelight programming model based on convention over configuration, may not make it into the first version.",

RESTful techniques have advanced past pretty URIs + JSON towards hypermedia systems that project business protocols over the Internet and support seamless business process and service composition. The Web provides a powerful capability for scale, resiliency, and ease of implementation with commodity infrastructure like caches and Web servers with commodity protocols (like HTTP, AtomPub, and OAuth). Moving from trial to adopt is indicative of our position that the Web is ready for primetime, not just for Internet-facing systems but as a practical base for enterprise systems delivery.",

At the outset a journey acceptance test will cover only one step, but as stories are completed the journey is expanded to encompass each stage in the user’s progress.

Some readers may be confused by our advocacy of Coffeescript given our general dislike for GWT, because on the surface they seem similar: tools that generate JavaScript. However, it is the level of abstraction that differs. GWT has an elaborate component model, which tries to hide details about the underlying language (JavaScript) and platform (the web).

It is about tightening your feedback loops and not putting off anything until the end. Continuous delivery is not the same as continuous deployment, which means deploying every change to production. Continuous delivery is not a cowboy show. It puts you in charge of your production environment. The business can pick and choose what and when to deploy.

Consider building an event API, which, when used in conjunction with a REST API, facilitates simple workflow, notification, and synchronization integrations. These integrations often require no more than 20 or 30 lines of code. Often event APIs take the form of a “web hook” or callback mechanism, but don’t be afraid of using a poll-based Atom style either.

As the standard continues to evolve we expect HTML5 will become an increasingly viable alternative to native applications with the distinct advantage of being inherently cross platform.",

Further, they provide the ability to reliably trace build artifacts as they progress through each stage on their path to production. Several vendors are now building CI servers that support the pipeline as a first-class feature and not just a visual element.

Once you add in analytics, business metrics, demographics, user profiles and multiple devices, it can become overwhelming. Many organizations use data warehouses as a repository with data being sucked in from all parts of the organization. The challenge here is that these often turn into “Data Fortresses.” Even getting timely business metrics becomes a challenge, let alone running exploratory queries across the entire data set. Technologies like the cloud based BigQuery help. The pay-as-you-go model and the ability to do ad hoc queries lets you gain insight without buying specialist hardware and software.

When using an embedded container, it is easy to set up the system, run the tests over HTTP and to verify the final state without the setup costs associated with deploying to and communicating with a separate container.",

Currently, the common tooling drives testers towards creating throw away code and a click-and-script mentality. Treating performance testing as a first-class citizen enables the creation of better tests that cover more functionality, leading to better tooling to create and run performance tests, resulting in a test suite that is maintainable and can itself be tested.",

GoCD has the ability to sequence workflows both sequentially and in parallel at many levels, to execute specific tasks only on certain machines as well as to deterministically promote and propagate artifacts, which is a key enabler for Continuous Delivery. These are capabilities that most Continuous Integration tools lack, and we recommend that teams who might have otherwise tried to build a deployment pipeline from their Continuous Integration server try GoCD instead. GoCD was built by ThoughtWorks, is open-source, and is available for free for all teams. The <a href='https://github.com/gocd/gocd/'>source code</a> is available under the Apache 2.0 license.",

It supports C# and F# as the primary language with bindings to platform-specific SDKs and the Mono runtime environment that works across iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Applications are compiled to native code instead of the typical cross-platform approach that renders HTML-based UI in an embedded browser. This gives apps a more native look and feel. When using this toolset, it is imperative that the platform-specific UI tier be separated from the rest of the tiers to ensure code reuse across different platforms. The application binary tends to be a bit bigger due to the runtime environment that is included.",

If the feature and develop branches are short lived and merged often, you are really using the power of Git, which makes these activities easy. However, a problem we often see is that these become <strong>long lived branches</strong>, which results in the dreaded merge conflicts many people began using Git to escape. A merge is a merge. Regardless of the source control tool or pattern you use. If you wait more than a day or two to merge, you could hit a big merge conflict. This becomes a real issue if you have a larger team. If you have more than a few people waiting to merge, you can have a serious a bottleneck. Introducing patterns like Gitflow require the discipline to merge often to be successful. So by all means use the pattern, but only if you have the discipline to prevent long lived branches</p>",

This <strong>“Security Sandwich”</strong> approach is hard to integrate into Agile teams, since much of the design happens throughout the process, and it does not leverage the automation opportunities provided by continuous delivery. Organizations should look at how they can inject security practices throughout the agile development cycle. This includes: evaluating the right level of Threat Modeling to do up-front; when to classify security concerns as their own stories, acceptance criteria, or cross-cutting non-functional requirements; including automatic static and dynamic security testing into your build pipeline; and how to include deeper testing, such as penetration testing, into releases in a continuous delivery model. In much the same way that DevOps has recast how historically adversarial groups can work together, the same is happening for security and development professionals.

One difference lies in treating <strong>APIs as a product</strong>, even when the consumer is an internal system or fellow developer. Teams that build APIs should understand the needs of their customers and make the product compelling to them. Usability testing and UX research can lead to a better design and understanding of the API usage patterns and help bring a product mindset to APIs. APIs, like products, should be actively maintained and supported, and, easy to use. They should have an owner who advocates for the customer and strives for continual improvement.

Critics accuse REST of causing chatty, inefficient interactions among systems and failing to adapt as client needs evolve.

But in our experience, it isn't REST that causes these problems. Rather, they stem from a failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an <strong>anemic REST</strong> implementation. In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services. This antipattern is closely related to the <a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html\">Anemic Domain Model</a> pattern and results in services that rank low in <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html\">Richardson Maturity Model</a>.

API gateways can provide utility in dealing with some generic concerns—for example, authentication and rate-limiting—but any domain smarts such as data transformation or rule processing should live in applications or services where they can be controlled by product teams working closely with the domains they support.</p>",

We find that these platforms are most effective when they're given the same respect as an external product offering. <strong>Applying product management to internal platforms</strong> means establishing empathy with internal consumers (read: developers) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues. Platform product managers look after the quality of the platform, gather usage metrics, and continuously improve it over time. Treating the platform as a product helps to create a thriving ecosystem and avoids the pitfall of building yet another stagnant, underutilized service-oriented architecture.</p>",

Rotating credentials, applying patches as soon as they're available and rebuilding systems from a known, secure state — all within a matter of minutes or hours — makes it harder for attackers to succeed. <strong>The three Rs of security</strong> technique is made feasible with the advent of modern cloud-native architectures. When applications are deployed as containers, and built and tested via a completely automated pipeline, a security patch is just another small release that can be sent through the pipeline with one click. Of course, in keeping with best distributed systems practices, developers need to design their applications to be resilient to unexpected server outages.

Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues.

For some organizations this is a cultural and business decision. Retail businesses, for example, often refuse to store their data on Amazon and they distribute load to different providers based on their data.

A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes deployed alongside each service process, perhaps in a separate container.

When applications are deployed as containers, and built and tested via a completely automated pipeline, a security patch is just another small release that can be sent through the pipeline with one click.

We see a new <strong>risk-commensurate vendor strategy</strong> emerging that encourages investment to maintain vendor independence for highly critical business systems. Less critical business functions can take advantage of the streamlined delivery of a vendor-native solution because it allows them to absorb more easily the impact of losing that vendor.

Google has published a set of <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless\">distroless container images</a> for different languages. You can create distroless application images using the Google build tool <a href=\"https://bazel.build/\">Bazel</a>, which has rules for creating distroless containers or simply use multistage Dockerfiles.

This leaves consumers in a difficult place when choosing and committing to a provider. Increasingly, we're seeing organizations prepare to use \"any cloud\" and to avoid vendor lock-in at all costs. This, of course, leads to <strong>generic cloud usage</strong>. We see organizations limiting their use of the cloud to only those features common across all cloud providers—thereby missing out on the providers' unique benefits. We see organizations making large investments in home-grown abstraction layers that are too complex to build and too costly to maintain to stay cloud agnostic. The problem of lock-in is real. We recommend approaching this problem with a multicloud strategy that evaluates the migration cost and effort of capabilities from one cloud to another, against the benefits of using cloud-specific features. We recommend increasing the portability of the workloads by shipping the applications as widely adopted <a href=\"/radar/platforms/docker\">Docker</a> containers: use open source security and identity protocols to easily migrate the identity of the workloads, a <a href=\"/radar/techniques/risk-commensurate-vendor-strategy\">risk-commensurate vendor strategy</a> to maintain cloud independence only where necessary and <a href=\"/radar/techniques/polycloud\">Polycloud</a> to mix and match services from different providers where it makes sense. In short, shift your approach from a generic cloud usage to a sensible multicloud strategy.</p>",

Regardless of size, microservices encapsulate a meaningful grouping of functionality and information to allow for the independent delivery of business value. This is in contrast to earlier approaches in service architecture which organized services according to technical characteristics. We've observed a number of organizations who've adopted a <strong>layered microservices architecture</strong>, which in some ways is a contradiction in terms. These organizations have fallen back to arranging services primarily according to a technical role, for example, experience APIs, process APIs or system APIs. It's too easy for technology teams to be assigned by layer, so delivering any valuable business change requires slow and expensive coordination between multiple teams.

Originally developed by J.P. Morgan, Quorum positions itself as \"an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum.\" Unlike the <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow\">Hyperledger Burrow</a> node, which creates a new Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), Quorum forks code from Ethereum's official client so that it can evolve alongside Ethereum. Although it keeps most features of the Ethereum ledger, Quorum changes the consensus protocol from PoW to more efficient ones and adds private transaction support. With Quorum, developers can use their Ethereum knowledge of using, for example, <a href=\"/radar/languages-and-frameworks/solidity\">Solidity</a> and <a href=\"/radar/languages-and-frameworks/truffle\">Truffle</a> contracts to build enterprise blockchain applications. However, based on our experience, Quorum is not yet enterprise ready; for example, it lacks access control for private contracts, doesn't work well with load balancers and only has partial database support, all of which will lead to significant deployment and design burden. We recommend that you're cautious in implementing Quorum while keeping an eye on its development.</p>",

Ark supports key backup <a href=\"https://github.com/heptio/ark/blob/master/docs/support-matrix.md\">storage providers</a> (including AWS, Azure and Google Cloud) and, as of version 0.6.0, a plugin system that adds compatibility for additional backup and volume storage platforms.

Supported by all major browsers and backward compatible, it's a binary compilation format designed to run in the browser at near native speeds. It opens up the range of languages you can use to write front-end functionality, with early focus on C, C++ and Rust, and it's also an LLVM compilation target. When run in the sandbox, it can interact with JavaScript and shares the same permissions and security model.

After working with it on a number of applications, our teams have come away impressed and report that the reactive (functional) approach improves code readability and system throughput. They do note, though, that adopting WebFlux requires a significant shift in thinking and recommend to factor this into the decision to choose WebFlux over Spring MVC.</p>",
